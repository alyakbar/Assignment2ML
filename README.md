# Assignment 2: Explanatory Analysis and Model Comparison

## Overview
In this assignment, we will perform an explanatory analysis of housing prices data before performing linear regression. Subsequently, we will analyze the data using Random Forests and Decision Trees to determine which model is preferred for predicting housing prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this assignment is provided in the file `Real estate.csv`. It contains information about various attributes of houses, including transaction date, house age, latitude, longitude, and house price of unit area.

## Tasks
1. **Explanatory Analysis**:
   - Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
   - Visualize the dataset using plots such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to gain insights into the relationships between variables.

2. **Linear Regression**:
   - Before performing linear regression, conduct feature engineering if necessary.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train a linear regression model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set using metric such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

3. **Model Comparison**:
   - Analyze the dataset using Random Forests and Decision Trees.
   - Train Random Forest and Decision Tree models on the training set.
   - Evaluate the performance of both models on the testing set using the same metrics as linear regression.
   - Compare the performance of the models and make a recommendation on which model is preferred for predicting housing prices.

## Files
- `Real estate.csv`: The dataset containing information about housing prices.
- `Assignment2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for performing explanatory analysis and model comparison.

## Instructions
1. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed on your system.
2. Download the dataset file `Real estate.csv`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Assignment2.ipynb`.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to complete the assignment tasks.
5. After completing the analysis, review the findings and make conclusions based on the results.
